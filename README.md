## What is Mantis now?

Mantis is nothing now but I plan to use it as a learning experience to discover raytracing algorithms and optimizations. I am very interested in 3D and with my two undergrad degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics & Engineering (M&E is one degree. Basically applied mathematics) and my love and self creation in artistic endeavors I am excited to be able to combine the intersection of all of my loves.

## What do I want Mantis to be?

As far as tech, the idea I have in my head is to have a Rust based raytracer that is distributed across multiple computers using the Haskell Cloud library. The is really a learning experience for me so this will be nothing fancy.

## How will I learn?

The first part I plan to go through Peter Shirleys Ray Tracer in a Weekend and then after I have that all neatly arranged figuring out how to integrate Haskell into my project. I also want to go through Matt Pharr's PBR Book so to get a deeper understanding of more of the topics and refine the quality and performance of my code. I imagine a timeline for all this to be half a year or longer realistically knowing my external work performance.
